\title{Generate the curve of a forest's average tree using the Kozak taper model}
\usage{
average_tree_curve(
  df,
  d,
  dbh,
  h,
  th,
  facet = NA,
  color = NA,
  mirror = TRUE,
  eq = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame.}

\item{d}{Quoted name of the section diameter variable, in cm.}

\item{dbh}{Quoted name of the diameter at breast height variable, in cm.}

\item{h}{Quoted name of the section height variable, in meters.}

\item{th}{Quoted name of the total height variable, in meters.}

\item{facet}{Optional argument. If supplied with the Quoted name of a factor variable(s), this variable is used to divide the plot into facets. Default: \code{NA}.}

\item{color}{Quoted name of a variable. If supplied, this variable will be used to classify the data by color. Default: \code{NA}.}

\item{mirror}{if \code{TRUE}, the plot will be mirrored, to resemble the shape of a tree. Default: \code{TRUE}}

\item{eq}{if \code{TRUE}, Kozak's taper model is adjusted and the equation is shown on the plot. Default \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Generate a ggplot curve of a forest's average tree using the Kozak taper model (Kozak, Munro and Smith, 1969).
}
\examples{
library(forestmangr)
data("exfm7")
head(exfm7)

# Get the data's average tree curve inserting the section diameter and height, total height
# and dbh variables: 
average_tree_curve(df = exfm7, d = "di_wb", dbh = "DBH", h = "hi", th = "TH",eq=FALSE)

# It's possible to get the average tree curve of each strata with the facet argument,
# and divide the data by color with the color argument:
average_tree_curve(df=exfm7,d="di_wb",dbh="DBH",h="hi",th="TH",facet="STRATA",color="GENCODE",eq=FALSE)
